          <h2>OPEN-PBL</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            OPEN-PBL APP is an <b>open source</b> software that manages <b>problem-based learning
            experiences</b> taken in vocational education. Schools can use the OPEN-PBL APP <b>for
            free</b> to ensure that their learning experiences are aligned with problem-based
            learning's theoretical framework and best practices. Small businesses can also
            take advantage of the problem-based learning approach's benefits by using
            OPEN-PBL APP <b>for free</b> in their employee training and development. </br></br>

            <b>What is PBL</b></br>
            Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is a learning strategy adopted - wholly or partially -
            by some schools in their educational architecture. At PBL, students learn by <b>solving
            problems</b> and <b>reflecting on their experiences</b>. They work in small collaborative groups
            where they learn what they need to solve a problem presented. In this context,
            the teacher acts more as a facilitator to guide student learning than as the holder of
            knowledge, as in traditional learning approaches.</br></br>

            Harvard, Minerva and the tech school '42' are some examples of successful initiatives
            of using PBL to develop <b>professional higher skills</b>. The strength of adopting the PBL
            strategy in vocational education lies in the <b>pragmatism</b> of their learning experiences,
            which helps to <b>speed up students' employability gains</b> in the labor market.</br></br>

            <b>Why using OPEN-PBL APP</b></br>
            Despite the advantages of adopting PBL-based educational architectures, only few schools
            fully embrace the PBL approach because it requires more expensive academic resources as
            they are often scarce and poorly scalable. The OPEN-PBL APP helps schools and businesses
            address these constraints by providing a set of features for managing the execution of
            <b>class trails to discuss problem-cases solving</b>, such as business and medical case study
            classes, sessions for discussion of tech projects solutions and more. To ensure the
            integrity of the application of PBL tutorial process, OPENPBL APP:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interacts with teachers to help them create and disseminate case-problems (CP),
            and evaluate student performance in CP discussion classes.</li>
            <li>Interacts with students to help them research and learn the academic skills
            required for CP analysis, and prepare the individual arguments for CP discussion.</li>
          </ul>
            </br></br>

           <p class="lead">
            OPEN-PBL APP’s set of features enables schools and businesses to embrace the PBL strategy in their
            architecture and educational systems without the need of acquiring expensive and non scalable academic
            resources. Thus, they can ensure the proper application and measurement of the effectiveness of
            educational architectures to:
            </p>
             <ul>
            <li>Deploy <b>fully student-centered educational systems</b> by embracing the use of PBL; or just</li>
            <li><b>Add some PBL experiences</b>> to their proprietary education systems.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>OPEN-PBL CONCEPTUALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p class="lead"></br>
          The process of conceptualizing and outlining the architecture of OPEN-PBL APP originated from doctoral
          research from the Department of Informatics of PUC-Rio. Currently, code development is coordinated by
          OPEN-PBL.ORG, which is responsible for applying best international practices for the creation, versioning and
          licensing of <b>free code</b>.</br></br>

          <b>Universalization of PBL</b></br>
          The primary mission of OPEN-PBL.ORG is to foster the use of PBL by social organizations, governments and
          small businesses that would otherwise not have access to the resources required for its adoption.</br></br>

          <b>Licensing</b></br>
          The license to use OPEN-PBL APP is BSD. The code as well as all instructions for its secure deployment
          can be accessed at github.com/openpbl.</br></br>

          <b>Monitor of PBL practices</b></br>
          OPEN-PBL.ORG maintains, in partnership with ”The Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-Based Learning”,
          the publication of a monitor of new <b>academic studies and PBL application cases</b>. The content of <b>PBL Monitor</b> is
          aimed at teachers, educators, T&D professionals, and education executives interested in following developments
          and discussions about the PBL learning strategy.</br></br>

          <b>Support for social actions</b></br>
          OPEN-PBL.ORG maintains a voluntary consultancy program for the free implementation of the OPEN-PBL application
          in educational initiatives promoted by municipal governments and non-profit organizations.
